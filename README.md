# Outperform

## Project Overview
This is a public GitHub library that aims to facilitate my learning journey. As a beginner, the code in this library may seem naive, but it represents my efforts and progress. 

The library features a character peripheral collection system that I developed on my own. I'm an enthusiast of 2D games and anime, and I often collect various character - related peripheral products. This system is designed for people with similar hobbies. Currently, it is still in the source - code stage and not fully completed.

## Function introduction
- **Information entry**：You can input details of the character peripherals you own, such as the name of the character, the type of the peripheral (e.g., figurine, poster), purchase date, and price.
- **Collection management**：The system allows you to manage your collection, including viewing, editing, and deleting peripheral information.

## Design ideas
- **Modular design**：The system is divided into several modules, such as data storage, user interface, and business logic, to improve code maintainability and scalability.
- **Single - responsibility principle**：Each function and class in the code is designed to perform a single, well - defined task.

## Here are some open-source projects that I am very interested in. I put the link and introduction here, so it won't be copied into my library. 
   1.https://github.com/bradtraversy/50projects50days
   -This is a small website for learning computer programming, with many training games available for enjoyable learning
   2.https://github.com/marketplace/models/azureml-deepseek/DeepSeek-R1/playground
   -China has a deepseeker AI model, which can sometimes be unstable due to excessive usage. This open-source link has increased the stable daily inquiry frequency
   3.https://github.com/yuruotong1/autoMate
   -An automated AI tool that enables computers to perform tasks on their own. I am very interested in him, but I have not tried using it yet
   4.https://github.com/LC044/WeChatMsg/?tab=readme-ov-file
   -This is a tool that I really love. I used it to package chat records between me and my friends as a meeting, which can generate HTML, Word, etc. You can listen to pictures and language, and also choose a time. I enjoyed it immensely
   5.https://github.com/langchain-ai/social-media-agent
   -This is a social media proxy tool that sounds interesting, but I haven't put it into practice yet
   6.https://github.com/SteveSuv/remix-t3-stack
   -Use for learning English
