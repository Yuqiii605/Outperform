# Outperform

## 项目概述
This is a public GitHub library that aims to facilitate my learning journey. As a beginner, the code in this library may seem naive, but it represents my efforts and progress. 

The library features a character peripheral collection system that I developed on my own. I'm an enthusiast of 2D games and anime, and I often collect various character - related peripheral products. This system is designed for people with similar hobbies. Currently, it is still in the source - code stage and not fully completed.

## 功能介绍
- **信息录入**：You can input details of the character peripherals you own, such as the name of the character, the type of the peripheral (e.g., figurine, poster), purchase date, and price.
- **Collection management**：The system allows you to manage your collection, including viewing, editing, and deleting peripheral information.

## 设计思路
- **Modular design**：The system is divided into several modules, such as data storage, user interface, and business logic, to improve code maintainability and scalability.
- **Single - responsibility principle**：Each function and class in the code is designed to perform a single, well - defined task.
